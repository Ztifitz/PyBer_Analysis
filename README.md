# PyBer weekly information summary

## Overview

This document is made with the intention of generating possible guidelines to better ByPer's operation. The analysis will focus on weekly ride information from January 2019 to April 2019. We will consider Average fare information as well as the aggregate earning for the period divided by type of city with the intention of focusing our growth strategies depending on the city size.

## Results
The initial analysis focused on calculating average fare per ride data and average fare per driver as seen in the table below.

The data shows that while drivers earn more per ride in the rural cities, the overall ride quantity is low. This may be due to the fact that with less drivers available, the more expensive the fare becomes. Urban cities are ahead in total fares, which works good for our business model. The next chart shows more explicitly the disparity in the fares generated by each type of city.

## Recomendations

To start, our recomendation would be to increase awareness of the advantages of becoming a PyBer driver in the rural areas. If we can increase our drivers numbers and decrease the average fare, more clients would use our services which would lead to an increase in total fares for the company and rides for our registered drivers. On the other hand, average fare per driver is low in the Urban areas, maybe an increase in fare to those areas to keep our drivvers happy could be in order. Lastly, an increased awareness campaign in the Suburban areas towards the potential customers as to increase the usage to Urban level can help boost our total fares.

These are just places to consider starting changes. Our analysis was limited due to the data cointained in the datasets, as we were unable to do a demographic approach or maybe a more complete scenario since the amount of cities contained was limited. We will continue our research with other areas to generate a better view of the company's situation at the moment. That will be discussed in another report.
